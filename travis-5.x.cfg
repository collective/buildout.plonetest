This file is DEPRECATED and must not be used anymore.
Please see README.rst for current instructions on how to use buildout.plonetest.

Note: the other travis-*.cfg files will be kept for now.
So if you really want, you can switch to travis-5.1.x if you only want to test Plone 5.1.
But these travis files will not work for Plone 5.2.

For information about the change, see this issue:

And see this PR:
